September 1 & 2
Learning Phaser.
Built the example game through the tutorial from Phaser's Documentation

Day 1: Sep 3
Tried to create from scratch using Vite/ Vanilla JS.
Installed Phaser Library
used Copilot to create generate the spacecraft I named Velox (Latin for speed)
I also used Copilot to generate a picture of a galaxy as the background.
I made the ship movable in X axis using the Left and Right arrow keys.

Day 2:
Spent time creating the Fire blaster weapon and learned abstracting. For the sprite, I used Copilot as well.
I learned to create sprites in Piskel. It was so easy. I created the first mob which I named "Dorque". 
I also created the score system. Phaser is a game changer. If find it very easy to make a functionality such as the scoring system through classes.
